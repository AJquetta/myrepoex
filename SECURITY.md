2. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by the project maintainer.
3. You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours, and the maintainer will work with you to verify and resolve the issue.
4. Once the vulnerability has been fixed, we will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Vulnerability Management

Here's an overview of our vulnerability management process:

1. Reported vulnerabilities are assigned to the primary maintainer within 48 hours.
2. The vulnerability is verified and a fix is developed in a private branch.
3. A new version of OWASP dep-scan is released with the vulnerability fix.
4. The vulnerability is publicly disclosed with due credit to the reporter.

## Bug Bounty

Currently, OWASP dep-scan does not have a formal bug bounty program. However, we greatly appreciate any vulnerability reports from the community and will publicly acknowledge responsible disclosures.
